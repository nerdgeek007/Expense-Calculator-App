# Expense-Calculator-App
This is my first React project. I have used HTML, JS, CSS. The feature of this app are-
1. We can add new expenses.
2. We can Filter the expenses based on year.
3. There is a chart which is showing expenses per month.
   For intall the dependencies run ```npm install``` then run ```npm start``` in the terminal
